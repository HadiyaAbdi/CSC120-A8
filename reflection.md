Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I  overloaded the following methods: Building -  goToFloor, goUp and goDown: this will allow a person move more than one floor.

Library class - addTitle and checkOut: it will add and checkout multiple books at once which make the whole method more flexible to a variety at once.

Cafe class - sellCoffee and restock: it now allows for multiple items to be restocked and specified into categories.

House class - moveIn, and moveOut: it allows to move out or move in multiples students at once. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
overloading was far more flexible but would ran into some errors often but was good overall. Something that would be helpful to remember is that you should use the overlaoaded methods inside your main too. overlaoding has different paramaets list.
